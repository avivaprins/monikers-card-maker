## Card making rules
### Content
* Clue names are beings (and usually human).
* Do not be afraid to make clues that are not universal. It adds to the fun!
* Descriptions should not use a word that you are not allowed to say (i.e., the name on the card).

### Physical properties
* Dimensions: for compatibility with Moniker's open-source PDF version, a card should be 56.1mm x 84.7mm.
* Cards should be opaque and indistinguishable from the back side.
